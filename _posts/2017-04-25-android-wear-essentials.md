**Abstract:**  
After developing my last project for Android Wear, I realized it, somehow, made me a better Android developer.  
During this talk, I'll explain the nuts and bolts of developing watch faces and apps for Android wear: from the platform constraints to describing step-by-step how to build a beautiful watch face without embedding any images.  
Ever thought radians, shaders, radial gradients, vector drawables, canvas, paths, xfer modes, shadows, quadratic curves were difficult concepts?  
These are pretty easy actually, and you'll be able to use those in your Android applications too.
