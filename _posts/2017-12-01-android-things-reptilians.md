**Abstract:**  
Whether you believe it or not, the Reptilians are everywhere, and we have never been ready to face them so far.  
We **were not** ready... Hopefully, this will finally change now that Android Things has been released. Trust me, they didn't want to see that happen.

Together, we will discover Android Things and see how we can create a machine capable of detecting Reptilians (with machine learning), but also capable of exterminating them.  
How? Using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, and discovering/using some specific Android Things Peripheral IO APIs, allowing us to interact with external physical components. Come see the power of Android Things.
