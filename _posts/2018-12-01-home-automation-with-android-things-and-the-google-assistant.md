**Abstract:**  
Smart lights are fun, but have you ever wondered how it works under the hood, when you say to your Google Home something like: "OK Google, turn on the lights"?

Could we just buy some colored LED bulbs for $10, and create our own home automation system, compatible with the Google Assistant?  
That's what we will see today, first doing some slight reverse-engineering to understand how those light bulbs work, and then creating an Android Things and an Actions on Google project to control those.
