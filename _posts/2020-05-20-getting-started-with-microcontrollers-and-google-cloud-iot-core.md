**Abstract:**  

Many online services exist to safely manage IoT devices on a large scale: "Azure IoT" from Microsoft and "AWS IoT" from Amazon are among the best known.

Google also offers its solution: "Cloud IoT" based on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
In this talk, we will start from a famous and affordable microcontroller unit.  
We will first discover how to write code for this MCU so we can get environment data. Then we will connect the microcontroller to the Cloud.
Our goal is to discover what these online Cloud IoT solutions offer, and why you may (or may not) need those.

We will focus on Google Cloud IoT core, core concepts remaining the same on other online platforms.
